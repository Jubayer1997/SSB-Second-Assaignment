		<h1>Beautiful Fog <span>Sunset in Bangladesh</span></h1>

	

		<p><strong>It is really very charming to enjoy the scene of a sun set in a cloudless sky in Bangladesh.</strong> It marks the end of the day . The sun goes down and sheds its mild rays from the western sky. <i>It looks like a dish of gold . We find a brilliant show of colors in the western sky</i> . Seven colors make the western sky look charming . The whole earth and the sky seem to be painted with colors . The golden rays of the setting sun fall on the water of ponds , rivers , on top of trees . The western horizon appears exquisitely beautiful . The sky is then covered with the red glow of the setting sun and all the objects of nature put on a charming appearance. The ripples of the rivers look purple in the red glow of the departing sun.Gradually the sun sinks down below the horizon and the red tinge of the sky begins to fade away . Darkness  then covers the whole earth. The cowboys return home with their cattle. Birds are seen flying back to their nests . Nothing but a few stars are seen in the western sky . A sun set scene in really enjoyable.</p>

	<b>Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation</b>. As viewed from everywhere on Earth (except the North and South poles),the equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the Spring and Autumn equinox. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the Northern hemisphere's spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.

The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.

Sunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages, the first being civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon;the second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon; 
 The third is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon.[1] Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night.[2] Night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.
